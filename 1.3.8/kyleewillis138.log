#Line 2 is necessary because you have to initialize the variable guess so you can search for it in answer. Having it in answer makes the user have no input.

#9. You need 6000 guesses to be entirely sure you're correct because there are 6000 numbers between 1 and 6000, and you have to be sure that your answer is actually the right answer, even if it's the only possible number left.

#so I'm editing the rest of this on github because I have like nothing left, but there's a few questions that I didn't quite finish...

#11a. Guessing someone's birthday could take as many as 366 guesses, but would probably take less than 183.

#It doesn't really explain what 'sorting a list' is, so should I just assume that that's putting the values in some order?
#11b. If a list is unsorted when you try to go through it with binary search, you'll get a value that's not the middle (whatever the middle happens to be). It's basically finding the median.

#11c. You get purple search history things in your search bar, the webpage might load faster, and when you open a new tab page, there's a little icon that shows this website.
